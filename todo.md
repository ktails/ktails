## Known Issues

Track current bugs and limitations:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è No error feedback when API calls fail (returns nil)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Window resize sometimes miscalculates pane sizes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No way to remove a pod pane once added
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Context switching modifies global k8s client state (not thread-safe)

Want to work on a feature? Here's the suggested order:

**For New Contributors:**
1. Status bar implementation (good first task)
2. Error display panel
3. Manual refresh (r key)

**Core Features (need design discussion first):**
1. Log viewing architecture
2. Search mode implementation
3. Auto-refresh strategy
